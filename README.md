# btfd
a script that uses simple technical indicators to check whether to buy or sell tickers (intended for low-volatility indices like SPY)

an AlphaVantage API key is required, and should replace the string that says "INSERT_KEY_HERE"

usage: btfd.py [-h] -t TICKER

    -h:             help
    
    -t, --ticker:   the ticker to track
